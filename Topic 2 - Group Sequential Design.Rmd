## Adding interim analysis
  
  + Power decreases (unless sample size is increased)
  + Expected sample size gets smaller
  + With increasing number of interim analysis, the total average sampel number (ASN) decreases (see slide 8 of Reference 1)
  
### Reasons for stopping
  
  + Stop for either efficacy or futility
      + this means stopping for both null and alternative hypothesis
      + Symmetric power for futility and efficacy decisions
      + Symmetric ASN for futility and efficacy decisions
  + Stop only for futility (null hypothesis)
      + Power for efficacy may decrease
      + ASN reduced for futility, but not for efficacy
  + Stop only for efficacy (alternative hypothesis)
      + Power for efficacy may decrease
      + ASN reduced for efficacy, but not for futility
  
### Selecting degree of early conservatism

  + O'Brien-Flemming design shows early conservatism (i.e., relatively difficult to stop at early interim analyses)
  + Pocock design is not conservative in early decisions (i.e., relatively easy to stop at early interim analyses)
  + Degree of conservatism does not have to be symmetric.
  
### Effect of early conservatism
  
  + More conservatism (harder to stop at early analyses)
      + Tends to give higher power
      + Tends to give larger ASN
  + Less conservatism (easier to stop)
      + Tends to decrease power
      + Tends to reduce ASN
  + Asymmetric conservatism
      + Often need early sensitivity for harm, but not conservatism for efficacy
      
      
      
### Design Evaluation
  + Elements that are established in the fixed sample design
      + Endpoint, prob model, functional, contrast
      + Maximal information (sample size, $N_j$; design alternative hypotheses)
      + Statistical standard for evidence ($\alpha$ level)
  + Evaluation of group sequential design:
      + sample size is a random variable; characteristics of interest:
          + Mean (Average sample size - ASN)
          + Quantiles (median, Q1, Q3)
          + Power curve
          + Power for fixed $N_j$
          + $N_j$ for fixed power
          + Stopping probability at each interim analysis
          + Inference at the boundary: what is the statistical inference (point estimate, interval estimate, and p-value) that would be reported if the trial is stopped?
  + Iterate: modify the stopping rules until an acceptable mixed of properties is found
  
  
## General Behavior of Group Sequential Design  
  + For any given sample size, adding interim analyses reduces power
  + For any given power, adding interim analyses increases the sample size
  + Having fewer interim analyses: 
      + leads to properties (maxmial sample size, power, etc) that are closer to those of a fixed sample study
      + however, ASN may be larger and stopping probabilities lower
  + Having more earlier conservatism:
      + leads to properties (maximal sample size, power, etc) that are closer to those of a fixed sample study
      + however, ASN may be larger and stopping probabilities lower.
